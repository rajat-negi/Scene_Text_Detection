# Scene_Text_Detection_And_Recognition

1) Introduction:
In the era of Digitization, large amount of text is still on paper, Fortunately, recent advances in computer vision has given us an easy and accurate way to detect and recognize text. In Computer Vision the method of converting the text present in images or scanned documents to a machine-readable format that can later be edited, searched, and can be used for further processing is known as Optical Character Recognition (OCR).

2) Business Problem:
The main objective of this Problem Statement is to detect the text from image and draw a bounding box around that text and then recognize that text within that bounding box.

3) Datasets:
  ICDAR Dataset- contains 1000 train images and 500 test images https://rrc.cvc.uab.es/?ch=4&com=downloads 

  SynthText Dataset- contains 800k images https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/scenetext/

4) Techniques:
  Research paper implemented:- https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.04256 

  For text detection EAST algorithm is used:- https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.03155 

  For text recognition CRNN based method is used
